# Pose_Estimation

Pose estimation is a computer vision technique that determines the position and orientation of a person or object in an image or video. It involves detecting and tracking key points on the body or object, such as joints in a human body, to understand their spatial configuration.
This technology is widely used in applications like augmented reality, human-computer interaction, sports analysis, and robotics. By analyzing the relative positions of these key points, pose estimation provides valuable insights into the movement and posture of the subject, enabling a wide range of innovative applications and interactions.
